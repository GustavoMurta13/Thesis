\section{Background Information}
\subsection{From Games to Videogames}    
    The concept of games have been around for millenniums, and their origins are dated to the very birthplace of civilization - Ancient Mesopotamia. In the history of this civilization we can find the first ever example of a recorded game, the Royal Game of Ur ~\cite{Videogames_IntroductionToTheIndutry}.

    The Royal Game of Ur consisted of a two-player game where each player races with their pieces from one end to the other over the twenty-square rectangular board. This game mirrors real-life events from its development, incorporating situations that occurred during its creation. The real-life scenarios depicted in the game continue to influence contemporary games, with current titles retaining the fundamental mechanics introduced by the original game. Although these mechanics have undergone updates, they still share the core principles established by the earlier game ~\cite{Videogames_IntroductionToTheIndutry}~\cite{RoyalGameUr_rules}.

    The civilization, since it's birth, have been growing and evolving but so did the games. The games matured to involve more complex mechanics, strategies and to use new technologies, such as wood, clay, rocks and finally computer technology, thus introducing the concept of videogames, as depicted in the Oxford English Dictionary as the concept of Videogames as: "A game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a monitor or other display (now usually a program running on a games console, personal computer, or mobile device); (also) a software package for such a game; cf. computer game n."\cite{videogame_oed}.
    
\subsection{Streaming Platforms Overview}

\subsubsection{Twitch}
    Twitch is a live streaming video platform with a primary focus on gaming. Users have the ability to broadcast their gameplay to an audience who tunes in via a web interface. Streams encompass a variety of content, ranging from casual playthroughs by amateur users to large-scale broadcasts of eSports competitions. Users can assume one of two roles within the Twitch community: broadcaster or viewer. A broadcaster shares their gameplay through a dedicated channel, while a viewer watches the channel. Each streamer is restricted to a single live channel, available for a predetermined period when actively broadcasting. To facilitate communication, channels are equipped with an integrated chat room, enabling interaction among users, both broadcasters and viewers \cite{Twitch_streaming_platform}.

    \subsubsection*{Broadcast Structure}
    The video broadcast structure on the Twitch platform, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:TwitchStreamStructure}, consists of five essential components. In the center is the Video component showcasing the live stream. Positioned at the top of this component are Options, displaying actions accessible to viewers during the stream. Below, broadcast information is presented. On the right of the video stream, two related elements are found: the Chat, facilitating interactions between viewers and the broadcaster, and the Send Message feature, enabling users to submit messages to the Chat.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \fboxsep=0pt\fboxrule=0.5pt
        \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Chapters/Figures/TwitchStreamSchematic.png}}%
        \caption{Typical structure of Twitch video streams, featuring its main elements}
        \label{fig:TwitchStreamStructure}
    \end{figure}

    Within the overall structure, three visual elements play crucial roles in conveying information about the events in a gaming broadcast. The Video element visually showcases the game play, while the Chat facilitates viewer interaction with the broadcaster and fellow viewers. Additionally, the Stream information element offers details about the content, including the name of the video game being played, the channel name, the stream title, and the relevant categories for the broadcast.

    \subsubsection*{Twitch Engineering}

    The Twitch platform has many engineering teams trying to empower live interactive communities, fostering the creation of unique, unforgettable moments in the dynamic interactions between streamers and their audiences. To reach this goal of a consistently high-quality experience in a seemly way these teams create services and tools and these are some of the steps \cite{TwitchEngineering}.

    The Twitch Video Ingest team manages the challenge of handling hundreds of thousands of simultaneous live video streams and distributing them globally. This is achieved through a system where creators' streams are received and prepared for viewing. Twitch operates data centers, referred to as edges, distributed globally and connected to local Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These edges enable streamers to quickly connect to the network, ensuring optimal video quality. Upon connection, the edge directs the stream to larger data centers known as Origins, which host numerous servers dedicated to transcoding streams into various bitrates and formats for the Twitch Content Delivery Network (CDN). This intricate process ensures viewers worldwide, on any network, can seamlessly watch their favorite streams.

    Following video ingestion, the crucial next step is transcoding, where the streamers' video streams undergo conversion into formats conducive to an optimal playback experience. This ensures an excellent viewing experience regardless of the viewer's device capabilities or network conditions.

    The transcoding system takes the incoming Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) stream from the streamer and transforms it into an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)-compliant stream. This transformative process generates multiple variations of the stream with diverse video resolutions and bitrates, offering viewers the flexibility to watch at the highest possible quality.

    Upon arrival at an Origin and completion of the transcoding process, the responsibility of delivering the stream to viewers swiftly falls under the purview of Video Distribution. Twitch upholds a global network of distributed data centers organized in a directed graph hierarchy known as a Replication Tree.

    When a viewer loads a live video page on Twitch, their request is intelligently routed to the nearest available data center. From there, the stream request is forwarded up to the Replication Tree. This hierarchical structure ensures an efficient and optimized delivery process. Ultimately, the request reaches the Origin, which promptly returns the stream data to the viewer, facilitating a seamless and quick streaming experience.

    In case not all viewers could watch the stream live the creators can record a Video On Demand (VOD) of their content and distribute it, being from all the stream or some of the best moments. The last one is denominated as Highlights.

% The template provides an \emph{easy to use} setting for you to write your thesis/dissertation in \LaTeX:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item  Select your school;
%   \item Fill your thesis metadata (title, research field, etc) in the file “\texttt{template.tex}”;
%   \item Create your thesis/dissertation contents using the files in folder “\texttt{Chapters}”; and
%   \item Process using you favorite \LaTeX\ processor (pdf\LaTeX, \XeLaTeX\ or \LuaLaTeX).
% \end{itemize}

% \mbox{}\Overleaf\ is a collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor used for writing, editing and publishing scientific documents. Like “Goggle Docs”,  for \LaTeX\ users”). You can edit and compile your \LaTeX\ source on the cloud, without installing software in your own computer, and, much like \emph{Google Docs}, you can share your document with others users and everybody can edit the same file at the same time (this may be dangerous).

% If you do not have an account in \Overleaf, you must \href{https://www.overleaf.com?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{create one first}.

% Once you have an account, please access the \gls{novathesis} template in \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/novathesis-v6-dot-10-dot-10/jhqwhtcwbmqc}{Overleaf} and select the green button \emph{Open as Template} (see \Autoref{fig:overleaf}).

% \bgroup
%   \itshape
%   Please notice that the version currently available in Overleaf (v6.10.10) is slightly outdated (current version is v\novathesisversion). A new version (v7.0.0) will be submitted to Overleaf soon.  Until then, please:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Download the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/archive/main.zip}{latest version} from the GitHub repository as a Zip file.
%     \item Login to your favorite LaTeX cloud service. I recommend \href{https://www.overleaf.com/?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{Overleaf} but there are alternatives (these instructions apply to Overleaf and you'll have to adapt for other providers).
%     \item In the menu select: \texttt{New project} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{Upload project}.
%     \item Upload the zip file.
%     \item Select “template.tex” as the main file.
%     \item Let Overleaf compile the document.

% \vspace*{-17ex}
% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{github}%

% \label{fig:github2}
% \end{wrapfigure}

% First of all, start by installing \LaTeX\ in your computer.  There are two main distributions, \href{https://miktex.org}{\ntindex{\MikTeX}}\ and \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{\ntindex{\TeXLive}}, and both of them are available for the~3 most popular Operating Systems: Linux, macOS and Windows.

% Be aware that a full installation of \MikTeX\ or \TeXLive\ will take near~5\,GB of hard disk space.  So, think twice before installing the full distribution.  See the \gls{novathesis} Wiki for the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/wiki/installing-latex#minimal-installation-in-any-of-the-systems-above}{list of packages required to compile the template}.

% Once you have \LaTeX\ up and running, remember to install a good \LaTeX\ text editor.  I recommend you to take a look at  \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides}{this post} in the \url{tex.stackexchange.com} site.  If you want a quick and dirty recommendation, try \href{https://www.texstudio.org/}{\ntindex{TeXStudio}}.

% Now, you must access the \gls{novathesis} repository in \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis}{GitHub}, select the green button \emph{Code} and then \emph{download} (or \emph{clone}) the template.  You will always get the latest version of the template (currently v\novathesisversion\ from \novathesisdate).


% \section{Getting Help}
% \label{sec:getting_help}

% \ntindex[Help]{}

% No! You don't have to use this template to write your thesis.  You don't even have to use \LaTeX.  However, writing a thesis is serious stuff, and which tool you shall use to write it is not a decision to make lighthearted.

% \LaTeX\ is hard enough by itself.  This template aims at making your life easier, but not easy. If you choose to use this template to write your thesis, you are very welcome.  However, don't expect me to provide you help with \LaTeX.  Look for help with your friends (you have some friends, don't you?), or search the web, or try even to read some book(s) on \LaTeX. In the end you will certainly find the experience rewarding.

% When you come to the point of “\emph{How do I do this with the \novathesis\ template?}”, remember…

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item To check the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/wiki}{\gls{novathesis} wiki} and have some hope!  \emojiSmile
%   \item \href{https://www.google.com}{Google} is your best friend.
%   \item Search the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/discussions}{GitHub Discussions page} for a question related to yours.  \emph{If and only if} you don't find one, then post your own question in English please!
%   \item Search the \href{https://www.facebook.com/groups/novathesis}{NOVAtheis Facebook group} for a question related to yours.  \emph{If and only if} you don't find one, then post your own question in either Portuguese or English, at your preference.
% \end{enumerate}

% When you post your own question, remember to \textbf{always} state the \gls{novathesis} version number you are using and referring to.

% Although the \gls{novathesis} template is endorsed by some Schools (e.g., \href{https://www.fct.unl.pt/estudante/informacao-academica/teses-e-dissertacoes}{linked from FCT-NOVA web site}), the \gls{novathesis} template \textbf{this not an official template} for any School.

% The \gls{novathesis} template exists to make your life easier and we do our best to make it compliant to the supported ($+25$) Schools' regulations but, in the end of the line, you and only you are accountable for both the look and the contents of the document you submit as your thesis/dissertation.
