\chapter{State-of-the-Art}

    The realm of automated event detection and content analysis has witnessed substantial progress over the years, aiming to enhance the overall experience for viewers, sports analysts, and enthusiasts of physical sports, video games, or sports in general \cite{BroadcatedGames_analysis_LOL}\cite{RTS_soccer_analytics}. The progression has resulted in advanced software capable of identifying and categorizing multiple events within a match or gaming session. This software can provide valuable insights into the sport and create tools to better understand the performance of players or teams \cite{ComputerVisionInSports}.

    In this chapter, we will present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in event detection and classification for video games. We will delineate the various events that can occur within various gaming sessions and the challenges that arise from each. Various approaches have been developed over the years and we will review them, and compare them against the most recent works that pertain to machine learning. We will also include some of the advancements in computer vision techniques that can be of use to the to be developed solution.  

\section{Gaming and sports video analysis}  % resulting in the features analysis (visual, audio, overlay text) and tools integrated to the game engine (NVIDIA Highlights [GeForce Experience])
    Many systems were created to detect events in video games. Some were implemented as fully automatic solutions and some others as semi-automatic. Still, any of them aimed to extract the most valuable information possible at each moment and translate it into a concise textual description.

    To extract all of that high-level information it is needed to collect low-level information and process them in a way that all together can translate to a particular high-level event. This low-level information can be denominated as \gls{LLF}. These \gls{LLF} allow to extract direct information from visual or audio elements, such as the progression of color in a certain element or the variation of noise in a certain frequency.

    Identifying high-level information in gaming and sports videos follows some common steps. Just as described in \cite{AutomaticEventDetectionTennis} first, it is needed to identify low-level audiovisual and textual features present in the streaming feed. Second, a sequence of those features is grouped to identify the movement of the video game character, the round of the game played, or other audiovisual components. The results from those groups are denominated \gls{MLR}, a representation of a higher level but that cannot be used to infer the events of the video. To infer those events it is needed some prior knowledge of the sport played in the feed. When the models from \gls{MLR} are processed with that knowledge the result is high-level information, denominated of \gls{HLS} where the semantic concepts are used to identify the events, for example when the colors of the screen turn grey and the character has stopped moving in a game of League of Legends it means that the character that the gamer is manipulating has died and it will be revived, as is depicted in \cite{BroadcatedGames_analysis_LOL}. The process is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:LLF_HLS_realtion} for a better understanding of the steps and the different levels of information present in a sports video.

        \label{fig:LLF_HLS_realtion}
    \end{figure}

    The following section presents a synopsis of the features present in video game feeds, as well as the strategies used to retrieve them. First, it introduces approaches made to sports videos that can be applied to video game feeds in the solution to be developed. Then it clarifies approaches already developed for video game feed and its system of event detection and highlights detection.

\subsection{Visual Patterns Analysis in Sports videos}

    Extracting visual \gls{LLF} involves obtaining information from pixel intensity values, edges, color histograms, and other elements. These features are identifiable for their ease of definition and extraction but possess limited semantic significance \cite{INTERACTION_BETWEEN_MODULES_IN_LEARNING_SYSTEMS_FO}. Nonetheless, relying solely on \gls{LLF} is insufficient for the development of intricate projects, such as automatic event detection due to the semantic gap.

    Therefore, to create a visual model to analyze a video game feed it is needed to rely upon \gls{MLR}. Visual \gls{MLR} are semantic concepts, which are derived from specific combinations of \gls{LLF}. In sports videos those specific combinations are related to standard camera shooting style transmission practices and domain-specific objects and their locations \cite{SOCCER_VIDEO_EVENT_DETECTION}, and in video games feeds are related to camera settings. Because the camera settings vary among individuals, the visual patterns are not identical but rather exhibit similarities.

\subsubsection*{Video event detection}

    Video event detection, highlight extraction, and summarization have been extensively researched over the years, especially regarding football. The Bagadus system \cite{RTS_soccer_analytics} effectively integrated data from multiple cameras installed in a stadium and data from sensors on football players. It provided a real-time interaction subsystem for experts to annotate soccer events. This system allows users to track specific players, view events in panorama videos, and create video summaries. Due to the high cost of expert annotations, it was developed another similar system but instead, it uses crowdsourcing to integrate annotations from crowd workers \cite{Crowd-based_Semantic_Event_Detection}. A Bayesian network-based method proposed in \cite{EventDetectionAndSummarizationInSoccerVideosUsingBayesianNetworkAndCopula} captured dependencies among extracted features based on the automatically learned joint distribution of variables for football video event detection.

    In addition to conventional highlight events like goals and penalty kicks, in \cite{SoccerVideoSummarizationCinematographyMotionAnalysis} is proposed to include scenes of intense competition and emotional moments in football video summaries. They measured the interest level of a video clip based on cinematographic and motion features. In this system, the feature analysis consisted of identifying the movement of the ball and the impact that movement had on the flow of the game. For annotating baseball videos, this article \cite{WebcastText_Baseball_Videos} aligned high-level webcast text with video content to avoid unstable performance caused by purely content-based methods. In this system, the feature analysis consisted of identifying visual features like camera movement, player movement, and ball movements, and combined with webcast text and text detected in the video resulted in tagging the pitching types. This article \cite{PlayerTrackingInBroadcastBasketballVideo} introduced a robust player tracking system and adopted player trajectories to detect highlight events and conduct tactic analysis. This system consisted of using background subtraction, edge detection, and object tracking algorithms to detect the movements of the players. After the features were obtained, it was filtered using particle filter algorithms to obtain a player tracking system. Finally, the motion analysis module analyzes it to infer statistical analysis of player movement, and events like shots made and to reconstruct the game in a 3D world simulation. Another system based on Basketball was proposed as a framework for basketball videos involving scoreboard detection, text/video alignment, and replay detection, formulated as a discrete optimization problem and solved using resource allocation approaches \cite{BasketballNovelFramework}. In comparison to the other approach, this technology used \gls{SVM} for classification tasks, such as shot boundary detection and object detection, and \gls{RF} and \gls{NN} for action and event detection.  

\subsection{Audio Patterns Analysis in Sports videos}

    The audio component of a sports video such as the voice of the commentator, music, and various kinds of environmental sounds is a very important type of media and very correlated to the video component. Various previous works on audio analysis have been developed to complement the visual component, such as \cite{AutomaticDetectionGoalSegmentsBasketball}\cite{AutomaticextractionHighlightsBaseball}\cite{AudioKeywordsSoccerVideo}.

    

<Audio Keyword Generation for Sports Video Analysis Min Xu1, Ling-Yu Duan2, Liang-Tien Chia1, Chang-sheng Xu2> (The selected low-level features are firstly extracted and tokens are added to create an observation vector. Secondly, we perform the training of initial HMM models using dynamic programming. Once the initial HMM models have been obtained, we can select a small number of testing data for adaptation for the incoming testing audio. Finally, we label the testing audio sequence as a series of predefined audio keywords according to the maximum posterior probability; HMM-based audio keyword generation system; Improved model of "Creating audio keywords for event detection in soccer video")

% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sec:introduction}

% This Chapter describes how to use the \gls{novathesis}\ template.  It is assumed that you have a working \index{installation} of \LaTeX, either local (in your own computer) or remote (in \Overleaf), and that you were able to generate a PDF for the default configuration of the template: a PhD thesis for \gls{FCT}.


% \section{Quick Start}
% \label{sec:quick_started}

% \subsection{With a Local \LaTeX\ Installation} % (fold)
% \label{sub:with_a_local_latex_installation}

% Follow these steps to get started with a local \LaTeX\ installation:

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Download \LaTeX.  There are two major \LaTeX\ distributions — \href{https://miktex.org/}{\MikTeX} and \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{\TeXLive} — that share lots of similarity, and \LaTeX\ documents are portable between them. This means that, for most users, both systems are equally usable.
%   \begin{description}
%     \item [\TeX-Live] is maintained by (La)\TeX\ developers and is certainly the best distribution you may install in your computer:  However, the default distribution will take more than 5\,GB on your hard disk… so, if you are not short on disk space, install \TeXLive!
%     \item[Mik\TeX] will, by default, install only a minimal set of packages. The extra/additional packages will be installed on the fly.  Installing packages on the fly is useful if disk space is limited, but has its own caveats in the longer term.  Definitely choose \MikTeX\ if you're short on disk space.
%   \end{description}
%   Which one to download?  There are \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/20036/what-are-the-advantages-of-tex-live-over-miktex}{pros and cons for both distributions} so it is essentially a question of where does your heart falls first!  Mine falls to \TeXLive, but yours can fall elsewhere!  \emojiSmile
%   \item Install \LaTeX. Installation of \LaTeX\ is as hard as installing any other software.  Just do your best and you will certainly succeed. 
%   \item Update your \LaTeX\ installation using the \emph{\TeXLive Utility} program ot the \MikTeX\ console.
%   \item Download the \gls{novathesis} template by either:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Cloning the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis}{GitHub repository} with
%     \begin{verbatim}    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis.git\end{verbatim}
%     or
%     \item Downloading the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/archive/main.zip}{latest version from the GitHub repository as a Zip file}.
%   \end{itemize}

%   \item \label{it:project_available} Download additional School specific files if applicable:
%   \begin{description}
%     \item[Universidade do Minho (UMINHO)] download the required \emph{NewsGotT} font files from
%     \url{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis-extras/raw/main/Fonts/NewsGotT.zip}\\
%     then unzip the file and copy the~3~font files
% \begin{flushleft}
% \hspace*{0.5cm}“\verb!n015002t.ttf!”, “\verb!n015003t.ttf!”, and “\verb!n015006t.ttf!”
% \end{flushleft}
%     to the folder
% \begin{flushleft}
% \hspace*{0.5cm}“\verb!NOVAthesisFiles/FontStyles/Fonts!”.
% \end{flushleft}
%     \item[Escola Superior de Enfermagem do Porto (ESEP)] download the required \emph{Calibri} font files from
%     \url{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis-extras/raw/main/Fonts/Calibri.zip}\\
%     then unzip the file and copy the~4~font files
% \begin{flushleft}
% \hspace*{0.5cm}“\verb!Calibri.ttf!”, “\verb!Calibrib.ttf!”, “\verb!Calibrii.ttf!”, and “\verb!Calibriz.ttf!”
% \end{flushleft}
%       \noindent to the folder
% \begin{flushleft}
% \hspace*{0.5cm}\verb!NOVAthesisFiles/FontStyles/Fonts!.
% \end{flushleft}
%   \end{description}

%   \item Compile the document with you favorite LaTeX processor (pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX).
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item The main file is named “\verb!template.tex!”, but you are free to rename it as you please.
%     \item Either load the main file in your favorite \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors}{LaTeX text editor} and press the appropriate (\emph{magic}) button to generate a PDF file, or open a terminal and compile it with “\verb!latexmk -pdf template!”. If you use a \LaTeX\ text editor, please notice that the \gls{novathesis} template uses “\verb!biber!” and not “\verb!bibtex!” to process the bibliography, which means that most probably you have to open the \emph{Editor Preferences} and somewhere (depending on the Editor you are using) change “\verb!bibtex!” to “\verb!biber!”.
%     \item Notice that, due to the external font sets used, \pdfLaTeX\ will not work for both \textbf{UMINHO} and \textbf{ESEP}, and you have to use either \XeLaTeX\ (“\verb!latexmk -pdfxe template!”) or \LuaLaTeX (“\verb!latexmk -pdflua template!”).
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Edit the files in the “Config” folder:

% \section{Additional considerations about the class options}
% \label{sec:additional_considerations}

% In this section we will provide some additional considerations about some of the customizations available as class options.

% \subsection{The main language}
% \label{sub:the_main_language}

% The choice of the main language with the option “\texttt{lang=OPT}” affects:

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{The order of the summaries.} First is printed the abstract in the main language and then in the foreign language. This means that if your main language for the document in English, you will see first the “abstract” (in English) and then the “resumo” (in Portuguese). If you switch the main language for the document for Portuguese, it will also automatically switch the order of the summaries to “resumo” and then “abstract”.
%   \item \textbf{The names for document sectioning.} E.g., ``Chapter'' vs.\ ``Capítulo'', ``Table of Contents'' vs.\ ``Índice'', ``Figure'' vs.\ ``Figura'', etc.
%   \item \textbf{The type of documents in the bibliography.} E.g., ``Technical Report'' vs.\ ``Relatório Técnico'', ``PhD Thesis'' vs.\ ``Tese de Doutoramento'', etc.
% \end{itemize}

% No mater which language you chose, you will always have the appropriate hyphenation rules according to the language at that point. You always get Portuguese hyphenation rules in the ``Resumo'', English hyphenation rules in the ``Abstract'', and then the main language hyphenation rules for the rest of the document.

% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sec:introduction}

% This chapter describes how to use the \gls{novathesis}\ Template and the \gls{novathesisclass} file.  I will assume you have a working installation of \LaTeX, wither local (in your own computer) or remote (in Overleaf), and that it compiled successfully the default configuration (PhD for \gls{FCT}).


% \section{Folder Structure}
% \label{sec:folder_structure}

% The \gls{novathesis} template is organized into many files and folders. At the main level it includes the following files and folders:

% \noindent
% \bgroup
% \rowcolors{1}{GhostWhite}{}
% \begin{xltabular}{\linewidth}{>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}l>{\upshape}X}
% novathesis.cls     & file    &
% The main class file. It will include additional files from \texttt{NOVAthesisFiles} folder and its sub-folders.
% \\
% template.tex      & file    &
% The main template file. You need to \emph{compile} this file with one of pdf\LaTeX, \XeLaTeX, or \LuaLaTeX\ to obtain the \texttt{template.pdf} file.
% \\
% bibliography.bib  & file    &
% An example of a bibliography file. You may have has many as you want. \\
% template.pdf      & file    &
% A possible result of applying pdf\LaTeX\ to the \texttt{template.tex} file. The template supports multiple types of documents (e.g., MSc dissertation, PhD thesis, …) and multiple Schools (e.g., FCT-NOVA, FCSH-NOVA, IST-UL, FC-UL, …) and each will produce different results.
% \\
% Chapters          & folder  & Examples of thesis chapters. Replace them with your own chapters.
% \\
% Examples          & folder  & Some more examples of the use of the template for different document types and Schools.
% \\
% Scripts           & folder  & Some (possibly useful) scripts for Unix-based systems (Linux, Mac OSx). If you are a windows user, ignore this folder (you may safely delete it if you want).
% \\
% NOVAthesisFiles   & folder  &
% Additional files for the \gls{novathesisclass}\ file.  Unless you know what you are doing, avoid messing up with the files and folders inside this folder (except for deleting the unused Schools, see below).
% \\
% \end{xltabular}
% \egroup

% The \texttt{NOVAthesisFiles} folder contains additional files and folders that complement the main \gls{novathesisclass}\ file.  These are:

% \noindent
% \bgroup

% \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}l>{\upshape}X}
% README.txt      & file    &
% A file that should be read!  :)
% \\
% fix-babel.tex   & file    &
% Simple fixes to the \texttt{babel} package.
% \\
% lang-text.ldf   & file    &
% Translations of important strings used in the template.  Currently fully supported are Portuguese and English, but French is on the way.  If you add translations for your own language, please be so kind and send them to me. Thank you!
% \\
% options.tex     & file    &
% Processing of \gls{novathesisclass}\ options.  \emph{Don't mess with this!}
% \\
% packages.tex    & file    &
% Additional packages to be loaded into the \gls{novathesis}\ template. \emph{You should not mess with this!}
% \\
% spine.tex       & file    &
% This file is loaded only if the option \texttt{spine=full} or \texttt{spine=trim}, and includes the typesetting of the book spine.
% \\
% ChapStyles      & folder  &
% Contains a lot of files, one for each chapter style.  If you really know what you are doing, you may add your own chapter style here.
% \\
% FontStyles      & folder  &
% Contains a few files, one for each set of fonts (main text font, chapter font, section font, subsection font, etc).  If you really know what you are doing, you may add your own set here.
% \\
% Schools         & folder  &
% Configuration files for each school.  This folder is organized into subfolders, one for each university.  \emph{You may safely delete all the subfolders except the one for your University.}  Then open the subfolder of your University and \emph{you may safely delete all the subfolders except the one for your School/Faculty}.
% \\
% \end{tabularx}
% \egroup

% As stated above, the \texttt{Schools} folder contains per-university folders and per-school (faculty) subfolders.  Currently these are the available folders:

% \noindent
% \bgroup
% \rowcolors{1}{GhostWhite}{}
% \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\ttfamily}r@{~/~}>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}l>{\upshape}X}

% The choice of the main language with the option “\texttt{lang=OPT}” affects:

% \begin{itemize}

This means that if your main language for the document in English, you will see first the “abstract” (in English) and then the “resumo” (in Portuguese). If you switch the main language for the document for Portuguese, it will also automatically switch the order of the summaries to “resumo” and then “abstract”.
%   \item \textbf{The names for document sectioning.} E.g., ``Chapter'' vs.\ ``Capítulo'', ``Table of Contents'' vs.\ ``Índice'', ``Figure'' vs.\ ``Figura'', etc.
%   \item \textbf{The type of documents in the bibliography.} E.g., ``Technical Report'' vs.\ ``Relatório Técnico'', ``PhD Thesis'' vs.\ ``Tese de Doutoramento'', etc.
% \end{itemize}

% No mater which language you chose, you will always have the appropriate hyphenation rules according to the language at that point. You always get Portuguese hyphenation rules in the ``Resumo'', English hyphenation rules in the ``Abstract'', and then the main language hyphenation rules for the rest of the document.
